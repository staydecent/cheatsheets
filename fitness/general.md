### Target heart rate

    max heart rate = (220 - age)

"The target heart rate method is a simple formula: take 220 and minus your age.
Then take that number and multiply it by .75 - .85, which will give you your
percentages of 75% -- 85% of your Max. HR."

### Metabolism

* At rest, 33% of the body's energy comes from carbohydrates, or glycogen, 
  stored within the muscles and liver. 66% comes from fat.

* During aerobic work, 50-60% of the energy comes from fats

* Primarily carbohydrates are used during the first several minutes of exercise

* For an average fit person, it takes 20 to 30 minutes of continuous aerobic 
  activity to burn 50% fat and 50% carbohydrate

* There is approximately a 7 fold increase of fat mobilization after 1 hour of 
  exercise

* Low intense exercise (less than 30% VO2 max) relies primarily on fat whereas 
  high intense exercise (greater than 70% VO2 max) primarily utilized 
  carbohydrate.

### Deloads on a cut

 - "I would never recommend traditional style deloads on a cut, regardless of 
 training regimen."

### Conditioning with 5/3/1

 - "For conditioning, I highly recommend 30-40 minutes of walking every day.  
 Yes,  walking. If youâ€™re asking why something so non-strenuous: if physique 
 goals are your only concern, do not let the conditioning take away from your 
 recovery."
